pyOperant is a software suite for olfactory discrimination training with laboratory mice.Although it was designed for use with "Slotnick" style olfactometers and training boxes, the code is object oriented, modular, and contains multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for easy inclusion of new training protocols and hardware. Please see the bitbucket page for more information.
